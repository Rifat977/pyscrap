Our farms also have dieticians present, making sure that our cows receive the proper nutrition needed to maintain optimum health and the great taste of our milk. In addition, each cow has her own sand bed. Sand is a naturally bacteria-resistant material that helps the cows rest comfortably as well as keeps the bacteria count low.

Not really. Maybe that's exactly why it works. Henry Schwartz, owner of the last dairy in New York City, had a fortuitous meeting with Dr. Cheryl Mitchell, who had spent decades developing HydroRelease- - a unique method using water to separate and draw the nutrients from nuts, grains, and seeds to produce a naturally smooth, creamy beverage without any added emulsifiers or thickeners. Inspired by Dr. Cheryl, Henry made the shocking move to close his 90-year-old dairy, start anew, and give its name -Elmhurst - to a new innovative line of plant milks.

Why is a nitro coffee company making an oat milk? Good question! We started Rise with a simple mission: to make better tasting beverages with better ingredients. To create our award-winning lattes we tested every plant-based milk on the planet, and oat milk was love at first taste. One problem! At Rise, we only use organic ingredients and organic oat milk did not exist. (That is not the problem, that is the future). So, we did exactly what we did with our coffee, and set out to make our own. Our ingredients do not include any gums and binders- simply organic oats, sunflowers, salt and water. We hope you enjoy it as much as we have enjoyed making it for you!  Barista approved loved by kids, too. No artificial colors. No gums. It's all good. Please recycle.
