Safeway,The Prisoner Red Blend Red Wine,$87.39,N/A,N/A,750 ml,Delivery to 94105,N/A,"The Prisoner Red Blend Red Wine, made with a diverse combination of dark red grapes to bestow distinct quality and character, is luscious, smooth, and balanced. This California red wine is inspired by the blended wines that were made by Italian immigrants who originally settled in Napa Valley. Crafted with an unlikely mix of zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, petite sirah, syrah, and merlot, this dark red wine blend features bright aromas of ripe raspberry, vanilla, and coconut. These scents give way to persistent notes of fresh and dried blackberry and pomegranate with a lingering vanilla flavor. Barrel aging in a combination of old and new French and American oak barrels brings out the full flavors of this red California wine, making it a great match for grilled meats, especially when they are topped with sweet or tomato-based sauces. Or enjoy a glass of wine on its own, savoring this delicious red wine's lusciously smooth finish that lingers on the palate.
